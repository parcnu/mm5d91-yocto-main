# Main instruction to create mm5d91_driver build for yocto
* used yocto branch scarthgap
* all meta- repos intended to be cloned into same level

# Clone repositories:
## clone mm5d91_driver sources
* mkdir source
* cd source 
'''
 # git clone https://github.com/parcnu/mm5d91-rpi4b-driver.git
'''
* this is your source path for later source file linking.
# clone rest of the yocto environment
'''

## source environment and create build folder
'''
 # source poky/oe-init-build-env build
'''
* you are now move to build folder. 
* copy conf files from source/mm5d91-yocto-main/conf to build conf folder
'''
 # cd conf
 # cp ../../mm5d91-yocto-main/conf/* .
'''
* run bitbake
'''
 # bitbake core-image-base
''' 
* takes time to build - several hours based on your computer
* image is created in folder tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64/
* use balenaetcher to flash memory card
* source file is core-image-base-raspberrypi4-64.rootfs.wic.bz2
# run image and test app
* connect ethernet cable
* connect mm5d91 module as instructed in <
* insert sd card to repi4b
* powerup the rpi4b
* from build computer ssh to rpi
'''
 # ssh root@192.168.xxx.xxx (check your ip from router)
